# Truss Stiffness Matrix Calculator
This MATLAB project calculates the global stiffness matrix for a given truss structure, which is essential for analyzing structural behavior under applied loads. It helps engineers and researchers determine nodal displacements, reaction forces, and internal member forces in a truss system. The project is particularly useful in finite element modeling (FEM), mechanics simulations, and civil or mechanical engineering applications, providing a foundation for studying structural stability and material responses.


## Features

- Computes global stiffness matrices for truss elements.
- generates a sketch of the truss by the inputs for verification.
- Uses cosine and sine transformations for element orientation.
- Supports multiple elements and flexible node assignments.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (Tested on R2021a and later versions)

## Installation
-Directly download and Import the files

-Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Raiden40/2Dtruss-simulator-matlab.git

## Usage!!

### Run TrussCalculations.m


## Sample Output
After running the script, MATLAB will display the computed stiffness matrices.
